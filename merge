 a Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic process describing a sequence of 
 possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained 
 in the previous event. Informally, this may be thought of as, What happens next depends only on the state of affairs now. 
 A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, gives a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). 
 A continuous-time process is called a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Markov processes are named in honor of the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.
